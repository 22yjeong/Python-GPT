# Python AI Assistant Documentation
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Python AI Assistant, a web-based application that utilizes a fine-tuned LLaMA model to help users with Python coding questions. The assistant is implemented using Flask and uses awbe interface to generate its responses.

# System Overview

Quantization: Uses 4-bit model quantization to reduce the model size and optimize inference speed, making it suitable for deployment on servers with limited resources.
Prompt Engineering: Employs custom prompt templates to enhance the model's ability to understand and respond to user queries effectively.

# Detailed Workflow

Quantization Configurations: The model uses a `BitsAndBytesConfig` for quantization which reduces the model size significantly by using 4-bit weights instead of the standard 32-bit. This helps in deploying larger models on platforms with memory constraints.
*Model and Tokenizer Loading**: The model and tokenizer are loaded with these quantization settings. Authentication with Hugging Face is required to access these resources securely.

# Prompt Modification
Update Function: A function `update_prompt` is defined to modify the dataset prompts dynamically based on a new template provided. This helps in tailoring the responses to be more context-aware and specific to the user's queries about Python.

# Web Interface
Flask Application: A Flask web server is set up to host the AI assistant. `ngrok` is used to create a tunnel to the web server, allowing it to be accessed publicly.
HTML Template: The web page is designed to be simple and user-friendly, providing a text input where users can ask questions about Python code. The responses are generated by the AI model and displayed on the same page.

# Interaction Flow
User Query Processing: When a user submits a query, it is processed by the AI model which generates a response based on the context provided by the modified prompts. The response from the model is then formatted to remove any special tokens and adjust the presentation for readability.

# Core Components

Training Arguments and Trainer Setup defines how the model should be trained, including settings for batch size, learning rate schedule, and optimizer. Dataset Management Scripts to load and preprocess the data, apply formatting, and manage dataset versions for training.

# Security and Authentication

Secure Authentication uses authentication tokens to securely interact with external services like Hugging Face and ngrok, ensuring that access is controlled and data privacy is maintained.
